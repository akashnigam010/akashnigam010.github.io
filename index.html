                    Finally, us ladies with zero figures and surfboard stomach get a little love!

In a new study conducted by the department of psychology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Dr. Filemón Alvarado and Dr. Edgardo Morales discovered that men who were in a relationship with a skinny women were TEN times happier than those who were with chubby women.

As a confident slim woman myself, I can testify that my husband is happy. Would he be happier with a fat woman? Who knows!

What I do know is that he loves my surfboard flat stomach, long carmael colored legs, and even my perfect jawline. 

According to the same study, men smile more with skinny partners and were more likely to solve problems easier.

Apparently, our higher BMI comes with a fascinating side effect of being able to anticipate our men's needs and satisfy them.

This is where I have to call bull----.

When I ask my husband which take out food he wants for the night, it turns into a problem that is not easily fixed nor can I anticipate what he really wants because no matter what, he will say, "Whatever you want."

But I'm assuming they're talking more of issues and desires that come with being in a committed relationship and not so much which food to order?
